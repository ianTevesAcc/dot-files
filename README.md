This is a repo full of my dot files.
Copy all files into a folder then move them individually.
```bash
mkdir ian-dot-files
git clone git@github.com:ianTevesAcc/dot-files.git ian-dot-files
```

Then move individually either with a file explorer application or by terminal commands.
```bash
# move them
mv selected-dot-file selected-directory

# or copy them to their destination
cp selected-dot-file selected-directory
```
